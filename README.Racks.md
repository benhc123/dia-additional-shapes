These shapes are for drawing schemas of 19" racks, rack accessories and
rack mounted equipment. Only few items are done so far, but you may try
to use shapes from sheets by other authors, notably Central Data Processing sheet
by Leonardo O. Martins. 

Latest versions are  available at http://www.eowyn.cz/dia


Size and Units
--------------

Dimensions used in the shape files are in decimeters, i.e. 1 == 100mm. All standardized
dimensions are represented (I hope) exactly, with the exception that equipment height is
in exact multiplies of rack unit (0.4445) and the 1/32" gap used to prevent binding
is ignored.


Shapes
------

rack_42u
...
rack_12u - 600mm racks in some common sizes (as offered by Schroff(tm))

equipment_1u
...
equipment_12u - stylised equipment boxes of sizes from 1U to 12U

power_strip_ute_8 - power strip with 8 Type E or Type E+F sockets, the most common in Europe.
power_strip_schuko_8 - power strip with 8 Type F sockets (Germany?)
power_strip_bs_7 - power strip with 7 Type G (British standard) sockets

rack_label_anchors_42u - 42U high measure with anchors for labels etc.

TODO
----

- more rack accessories (patch panels, fiber organizers, shelves, kbd, monitor, ...)
- more power socket types (American, ...)
- some recognizable devices (server, router, switch, ...)
- rails and equipment with holes
- rack door (glass, perforated)
- 800mm racks
- it would be better to generate appropriate rack and equipment sizes instead
